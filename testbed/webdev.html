            The program "Development of Web applications with HTML / CSS /
            Javascript / jQuery / AJAX and Bootstrap" is designed for people who
            have no knowledge or little knowledge of programming on the Web. It
            starts with presenting techniques for designing and developing web
            pages with HTML / CSS / Javascript languages. The Javascript
            language will be presented with detail as it is the basis for more
            advanced topics that will be presented later such as jQuery / AJAX /
            JSON / XML and Bootstrap. There will also be Web Server topics where
            learners will install and use Apache Tomcat as well as Web Hosting
            and file transfer and management issues using tools such as
            FileZilla. Also included is the presentation of UI & UX design
            techniques (User Interface and User Experience Design) so that
            learners are able to understand the visualization techniques of a
            web page, as well as the presentation of GitHub and Git, in order
            for learners to gradually create a portfolio for their personal or
            professional development in the labor market.
