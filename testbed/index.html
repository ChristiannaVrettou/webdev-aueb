      The program "Development of Web applications with HTML / CSS / Javascript
      / jQuery / AJAX and Bootstrap" is designed for people who have no
      knowledge or little knowledge of programming on the Web. It starts with
      presenting techniques for designing and developing web pages with HTML /
      CSS / Javascript languages. The Javascript language will be presented with
      detail as it is the basis for more advanced topics that will be presented
      later such as jQuery / AJAX / JSON / XML and Bootstrap. There will also be
      Web Server topics where learners will install and use Apache Tomcat as
      well as Web Hosting and file transfer and management issues using tools
      such as FileZilla. Also included is the presentation of UI & UX design
      techniques (User Interface and User Experience Design) so that learners
      are able to understand the visualization techniques of a web page, as well
      as the presentation of GitHub and Git, in order for learners to gradually
      create a portfolio for their personal or professional development in the
      labor market.
